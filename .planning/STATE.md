## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- All session data from stdin — no external lookups needed for model, context, rate limits
- Single TOML config file for all settings
- NWS + local astral sun times (not wttr.in)
- Cache weather (~10min) / alerts (~5min) to temp file
- Reuse NWS HTTP client from WxDesktopPy at `/home/kcreasey/Documents/Projects/WxDesktopPy`

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `requests` dependency imported in main.py but not declared in pyproject.toml — must be added in Phase 1
